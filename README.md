## Overview

This project explores various deep learning techniques to generate 3D skeletal animations. The main goals are to:

- Develop models that can learn from motion capture data.
- Generate smooth and realistic 3D skeletal animations.


## Features
1. **Generating future frames from the past frames**

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Change directory to the projects root directory**

3. **Create a new Conda environment with Python 3.12:**

   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.12
   ```
      
4. **Then, activate the environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

5. **Install the requriments**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
